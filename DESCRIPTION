Description: Spatial versions of Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDDs) are rising in popularity in the social sciences as a tool for causal inference. 
    Most of the required steps to produce state-of-the-art analysis, though, are cumbersome and time consuming. This package includes all functionalities to carry out the necessary spatial and econometric tasks in a unified fashion.
    It further gives researchers the ability to carry out the crucial placebo- and balancing checks in a detailed and thorough way. The fact that researchers do not have to rely on any outside software such as GIS APIs ensures replicability, and raises the standard for spatial RDDs.
