Description: Spatial versions of Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDDs) are rising in popularity as a tool for causal inference. 
    Most of the required steps to produce state-of-the-art analysis, though, are cumbersome and time-consuming. This package includes all functionalities to carry out the necessary spatial and econometric tasks in a unified fashion.
    It further gives researchers the ability to carry out the crucial placebo- and balancing checks in a detailed and thorough way. The fact that researchers do not have to rely on any outside software such as 'GIS' 'APIs' ensures replicability and raises the standard for spatial RDDs.
