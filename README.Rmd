# Spatial[R]()DD

This repository hosts the code underlying the R package `SpatialRDD`. The workhorse functions in a nutshell are:

* `assign_treated()`
* `border_segment()`
* `discretise_border()`
* `spatialrd()`
* `plotspatialrd()`
* `printspatialrd()`
* `shift_border()`
* `cutoff2polygon()`

The package can estimate heterogenous treatment effects alongside an RD cutoff. Moreover it provides powerful spatial functions to carry out placebo exercises (move borders and reassign (placebo) treatment status). These functionalities are also useful for different empirical identification strategies that rely on flexibly changing geographic boundaries. 

For full guidance check out the different vignettes in the vignettes folder here on github or with

* `vignette(spatialrdd_vignette)`
* `vignette(shifting_borders)`

in the R console. 

## Installation

```{r install_pkg, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("axlehner/SpatialRDD")
```

What you need to run you own spatial RD with `SpatialRDD`:
1. An RD boundary as a single line (the simplest way is to cut this by hand in e.g. ArcGIS or QGIS by just splitting the features - also make sure to merge all features together in case there are multiple left, this will be important and prevent annoying troubles in the RD process)
2. The data frame containing the columns with x- and y-coordinates. Read in with `read.csv()` or with `readstata13::read.dta13()`. Make them an sf object with `st_as_sf(data, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)` if you have longitude/latitude as coordinates. If this is the case use `st_transform()` on all your objects into a local UTM projection (not necessary but recommended for several reasons)
3. Ideally also a polygon that covers the treated areas (this could be created within the package with `cutoff2polygon` though)

You could verify the "geographic validity" of your objects with e.g. `mapview::mapview()`.

## Quick Guide

```{r load_pkg, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
library(SpatialRDD); data(cut_off.sf, polygon_full.sf, polygon_treated.sf)
# simulate some data
set.seed(1088) # set a seed to make the results replicable
points_samp.sf <- sf::st_sample(polygon_full.sf, 1000)
points_samp.sf <- sf::st_sf(points_samp.sf) # make it an sf object bc st_sample only created the geometry list-column (sfc)
points_samp.sf$id <- 1:nrow(points_samp.sf) # add a unique ID to each observation
points_samp.sf$treated <- assign_treated(points_samp.sf, polygon_treated.sf, id = "id") # assign treated

points_samp.sf$education[points_samp.sf$treated == 1] <- 0.7
points_samp.sf$education[points_samp.sf$treated == 0] <- 0.6
points_samp.sf$education[points_samp.sf$treated == 1] <- rnorm(NTr, mean = 0, sd = .1) + points_samp.sf$education[points_samp.sf$treated == 1]
points_samp.sf$education[points_samp.sf$treated == 0] <- rnorm(NCo, mean = 0, sd = .1) + points_samp.sf$education[points_samp.sf$treated == 0]
```

Adding border segment for transparent fixed effect category creation (for the non-parametric specification that is just OLS with `lm()` or `lfe::felm()`):

```{r border_segment, message = F, warning = F}
points_samp.sf$segment5 <- border_segment(points_samp.sf, cut_off.sf, 5)
tm_shape(points_samp.sf) + tm_dots("segment5", size = 0.1) + tm_shape(cut_off.sf) + tm_lines()
```

Create points alongside border and run GRD to explore heterogeneity:

```{r grd, message = F, warning = F}
borderpoints.sf <- discretise_border(cutoff = cut_off.sf, n = 50)
results <- spatialrd(y = "education", data = points_samp.sf, cutoff.points = borderpoints.sf, treated = "treated", minobs = 10)
plotspatialrd(results, map = T)
```
